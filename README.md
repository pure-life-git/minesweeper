# minesweeper
A quick minesweeper game I made in Python to refine my understanding of NumPy arrays and other concepts

Controls are pretty simple. To flag a space, enter 'flag', press enter, and then enter the coordinates you would like to flag.
You win the game when you have flagged all of the bombs.
I might make it so you can change difficulties in the future (no promises)
